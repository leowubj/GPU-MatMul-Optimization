		Team Self Evaluation Form, Assignment #2

Each team must submit one copy of this self evaluation form. 
The members of each team should discuss how they
worked together and what to write for the evaluation.

(1) List the names of your team members:

A: Yuke Liu

 
B: Jingyu Wu

 
 
(2) Estimate how much time each team member devoted to this project, in HOURS.

  	                        A 	       B
meetings 	  	  	          5          5
coding 	  	  	            20         10
writeup 	  	  	          5          10
planning (alone) 	  	  	  5         5
total (including meetings) 	35        30   	  	 


(3) Describe 
  (a) what the major responsibilities of each team member were;
      A takes major role in writing new codes and optimizing kernel method;
      B takes more responsibilities in debugging and writing the report.
  (b) whether or not you completed the assignment;
      We completed the assignment.
  (c) the major strengths and weaknesses in your team, e.g. how
      your team worked together;
      A is better at writing new codes and optimizing kernel method;
      B is better at debugging and writing the report.
  (d) the lessons learned from these events;
      We learned how to implement and optimize matrix multiplication for NVIDIA's Turing GPU.
  (e) whether and how you plan to change the way your work together and
      We plan not to change the way we work together.
  (f) anything else that comes to mind.
